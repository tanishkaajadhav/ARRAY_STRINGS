a. Create Input Output – CREATEIO.cpp

AIM:
To create an array, take input from the user, and display the elements in C++.

APPARATUS:
Laptop with C++ compiler (MinGW), Text Editor / IDE (VS Code), Terminal/Console (Command Prompt).

THEORY:
Arrays in C++ are used to store multiple elements of the same data type in contiguous memory locations. Elements can be accessed using indices. Input and output operations for arrays are commonly performed using loops.

ALGORITHM:

Start the program and include necessary header files.

Declare an array and a variable for its size.

Accept size and elements of the array from the user.

Use a loop to display the elements.

Stop the program.

CONCLUSION:
The program successfully accepts and displays the array elements in C++.

b. Reversing Array – REVERSEARRAY.cpp

AIM:
To reverse the elements of an array using C++.

APPARATUS:
Laptop with C++ compiler (MinGW), Text Editor / IDE (VS Code), Terminal/Console (Command Prompt).

THEORY:
Reversing an array means rearranging elements such that the first element becomes the last, and so on. This is typically done by traversing the array from the end to the beginning.

ALGORITHM:

Start the program and include necessary header files.

Accept the size and elements of the array.

Traverse the array in reverse order and display elements.

Stop the program.

CONCLUSION:
The program successfully reverses the array elements.

c. Search Element in Array – SEARCHELEMENT.cpp

AIM:
To search for a given element in an array using C++.

APPARATUS:
Laptop with C++ compiler (MinGW), Text Editor / IDE (VS Code), Terminal/Console (Command Prompt).

THEORY:
Searching in an array can be performed using linear search, where each element is compared with the key sequentially until the element is found or the array ends.

ALGORITHM:

Start the program and include necessary header files.

Accept the size and elements of the array.

Input the element to be searched.

Use a loop to compare each element with the key.

If found, display its position; otherwise, indicate not found.

Stop the program.

CONCLUSION:
The program successfully searches and locates an element in the array.

d. Sum and Average of Array – SUMAVG.cpp

AIM:
To calculate the sum and average of array elements using C++.

APPARATUS:
Laptop with C++ compiler (MinGW), Text Editor / IDE (VS Code), Terminal/Console (Command Prompt).

THEORY:
By iterating through all elements of an array, the sum can be computed. The average is obtained by dividing the sum by the number of elements.

ALGORITHM:

Start the program and include necessary header files.

Accept the size and elements of the array.

Use a loop to calculate the sum.

Divide the sum by the total number of elements to get the average.

Display the sum and average.

Stop the program.

CONCLUSION:
The program successfully calculates the sum and average of the array elements.

e. Finding Max & Min Element – MAXMIN.cpp

AIM:
To find the maximum and minimum elements in an array using C++.

APPARATUS:
Laptop with C++ compiler (MinGW), Text Editor / IDE (VS Code), Terminal/Console (Command Prompt).

THEORY:
To find maximum and minimum, iterate through all elements and update the maximum when a larger value is found, and update the minimum when a smaller value is found.

ALGORITHM:

Start the program and include necessary header files.

Accept the size and elements of the array.

Initialize variables for maximum and minimum.

Traverse the array to update max and min values.

Display the maximum and minimum.

Stop the program.

CONCLUSION:
The program successfully finds the maximum and minimum element in the array.

f. Concatenate Strings – CONCATENATED.cpp

AIM:
To concatenate two strings in C++.

APPARATUS:
Laptop with C++ compiler (MinGW), Text Editor / IDE (VS Code), Terminal/Console (Command Prompt).

THEORY:
String concatenation means joining two strings together. In C++, this can be done using the + operator or the append() function.

ALGORITHM:

Start the program and include necessary header files.

Input two strings from the user.

Concatenate the strings using +.

Display the concatenated string.

Stop the program.

CONCLUSION:
The program successfully concatenates two strings.

g. Reverse String – REVERSESTRING.cpp

AIM:
To reverse a string in C++.

APPARATUS:
Laptop with C++ compiler (MinGW), Text Editor / IDE (VS Code), Terminal/Console (Command Prompt).

THEORY:
Reversing a string involves printing its characters from the last to the first index.

ALGORITHM:

Start the program and include necessary header files.

Input a string from the user.

Traverse the string from end to start and display it.

Stop the program.

CONCLUSION:
The program successfully reverses the given string.

h. Palindrome Check – PALINDROME.cpp

AIM:
To check whether a given string is a palindrome using C++.

APPARATUS:
Laptop with C++ compiler (MinGW), Text Editor / IDE (VS Code), Terminal/Console (Command Prompt).

THEORY:
A palindrome is a word that reads the same backward as forward. By comparing the original string with its reverse, we can check for palindrome property.

ALGORITHM:

Start the program and include necessary header files.

Input a string from the user.

Reverse the string.

Compare the reversed string with the original.

If they are equal, display “Palindrome”; else display “Not Palindrome”.

Stop the program.

CONCLUSION:
The program successfully checks whether a string is a palindrome or not.
